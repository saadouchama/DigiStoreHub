## üõ†Ô∏è Mutation Type

The `Mutation` type defines operations for creating, updating, and deleting data.

### Examples of Mutations:

- **Create Product**
  - **Input**: `CreateProductInput`
  - **Returns**: `Product`

- **Register User**
  - **Input**: `RegisterInput`

- **Login User**
  - **Input**: `LoginInput`
  - **Returns**: `AuthPayload`

- **Update User**
  - **Input**: `UpdateUserInput`, `id`: ID!
  - **Returns**: `User`

These are just a few examples. Each mutation has its specific input requirements and returns a specific type or a Boolean in cases such as logout.

## üìù Input Types

Input types are used in mutations to pass data. Examples include `CreateProductInput`, `RegisterInput`, `LoginInput`, etc. Each input type requires specific fields to be filled, like name, email, password for user registration.

## Conclusion

This GraphQL schema provides a solid foundation for a web application managing users, products, orders, and reviews. Through queries, users can fetch data, while mutations allow for data manipulation, including registering users, adding products, creating orders, and more. Custom scalars like `DateTime` and `Upload` enhance functionality by allowing for specialized data types.
